WebAssembly (Wasm) is a versatile binary instruction format enabling
high-performance code execution across diverse environments. As Wasm gains
momentum with continuous feature enhancements, the specification of its
execution semantics becomes pivotal. Wasm-DSL has emrged as an innovative
approach to streamline the meticulous documentation process: Wasm-DSL is used
as front-end language to define semantics and the generation of both formal and
prose notations as back-ends is automated. While generating formal notations is
relatively straightforward, the challenge of generating accurate and consistent
prose notations arises due to the fundamental disparity between prose and
formal notations.

This paper presents Algorithmic Language (AL), an executable language designed
to resemble prose, automating the generation of precise prose descriptions. AL
is extracted from Wasm-DSL, and a comprehensive testing framework validates its
correctness.  This approach addresses the challenges posed by manual
specification composition and offers a transformative solution for enhancing
the accuracy and efficiency of programming language specifications.
