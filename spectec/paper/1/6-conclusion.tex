\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
To address the challenge of extracting prose specification of Wasm from DSL, we
introduced Algorithmic Language (AL), an executable language closely mirroring
the structure and style of prose notation. AL serves as an intermediary step in
the automated generation of precise prose descriptions from Wasm-DSL. We
established an automated pipeline for extracting AL from Wasm-DSL and validated
the correctness of these descriptions by developing an AL interpreter and
subjecting it to rigorous testing against the official WebAssembly test suite.
Our results showcased a 100\% pass rate, affirming the consistency and accuracy
of the extracted prose descriptions.

In summary, our research presents a significant advancement in the realm of
programming language specification. We offer an innovative solution to
streamline the process of generating precise prose notation from formal
semantics, mitigating the complexities and risks associated with manual
composition. This approach not only enhances the accuracy and clarity of Wasm's
documentation but also has the potential to revolutionize the field of
programming language specification, bridging the gap between declarative and
algorithmic descriptions.
