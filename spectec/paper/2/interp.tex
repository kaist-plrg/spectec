\subsection{Interpreter Backend}\label{sec:interp} %1p
\dslname supports the interpretation of Wasm programs by \textit{meta-level interpretation}.
By interpreting an \al program that denotes the Wasm semantics, with
a Wasm program as its input value, we can indirectly interpret the Wasm program.

This approach was previously used by the ESMeta framework~\cite{esmeta,jiset}.
ESMeta extracts two main components from the ECMAScript specification~\cite{ecmascript}:
a parser and executable semantics.
The parser is generated from the grammar section in the specification,
which takes a JavaScript program as input and returns a parsed AST as output.
The executable semantics is generated from the structured English prose algorithms in the specification,
and is translated into an internal representation, \ires.
\ires has its own semantics, so it can be executed by an interpreter implementation.
By executing the extracted semantics written in \ires using the parsed AST as input to the semantics,
we can indirectly execute JavaScript programs.

\dslname allows indirect execution of Wasm programs in a similar way.
A parser parses a Wasm program into an AST, which an \al algorithm takes as input.
Unlike ESMeta, \dslname does not generate a Wasm parser,
but uses the parser of the reference interpreter~\cite{wasmparser}.
The executable semantics written in \al is automaitcally extractd as described in Section~\ref{sec:dl2al}.
Based on the AL semantics~\cite{il-tr}, we developed an \al interpreter in OCaml,
which takes the extracted Wasm semantics and a parsed AST as input
and returns a resulting value or produces a \textit{trap}.
%Specifically, we can specify which \al algorithm to execute as a main entry of the extracted semantics.
%Currently, the Wasm specification has two main entry algorithms:
%$\mathit{instantiate}$ and $\mathit{invoke}$. 
%The $\mathit{instantiate}$ algorithm instantiates the Wasm module into the module instance,
%and the $\mathit{invoke}$ algorithm invokes one of the Wasm functions within the Wasm module.
%These algorithms in turn recursively call other algorithms,
%including those corresponding to the semantics of individual Wasm instructions like `REF.IS\_NULL'.
%This result constitutes the final result of executing the Wasm program,
%encompassing both the instantiation of the Wasm module and the invocation of the Wasm function.
