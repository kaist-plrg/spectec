\subsection{Interpreter Backend}\label{sec:interp} %1p
%
%  ESMeta parses the structured English prose algorithms of ECMAScript
% Specification document, and translates them into an internal representation, $IR_{ES}$.
%   $IR_{ES}$ has its own semantics, and thus can be executed with an interpreter implementation.
%   Executing the JavaScript semantics written in $IR_{ES}$ allows an indirect execution of JavaScript programs.
%   Utilizing the executable semantics, ESMeta derives a type checker for the specification, test
% suite synthesizers, and a static analyzer of JavaScript.
%
% Now, each ECMA-262 PR will execute the ESMeta type checker, and any new or changed tests in a Test262 PR will be executed using the ESMeta interpreter.
