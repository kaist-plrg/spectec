\subsection{Interpreter Backend}\label{sec:interp} %1p
\dslname supports the interpretation of Wasm programs by \textit{meta-level interpretation}.
By interpreting an \al program that denotes the Wasm semantics with
a Wasm program as its input value, we can indirectly interpret the Wasm program.
This approach was previously used by the ESMeta framework~\cite{esmeta,jiset},
which extracts an executable semantics from the ECMAScript prose specification~\cite{ecmascript}.
ESMeta parses the structured English prose algorithms in the specification,
and translates them into its internal representation, \ires.
\ires has its own semantics, and thus can be executed with an interpreter implementation.
Executing the JavaScript semantics written in \ires allows an indirect execution of JavaScript programs.
Similarly, we execute the Wasm semantics written in \al for an indirect execution of Wasm programs.

\item Wasm text format, parser, ...
\item Borrowed implementation from the reference interpreter
\item Handwritten parts?
\item How to execute a Wasm program
