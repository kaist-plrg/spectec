\subsection{Prose Backend}\label{sec:prose} %0.5p
AL is designed to provide a close and easy representation and manipulation of
the Wasm semantics in the official prose specification.
Thus, the English prose in reStructuredText markup can be generated directly from the definitions in AL.
\dslname can also support the interpretation of Wasm programs,
following the approach of the ESMeta framework.
