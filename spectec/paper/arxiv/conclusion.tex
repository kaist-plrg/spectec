\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have presented Wasm \dslname, a technology for automatically
generating various artefacts from a single source of truth, written in the Wasm specification DSL.
We hope to replace the artefacts of the Wasm specification process
which are today onerously crafted by hand with those generated by Wasm \dslname.
This approach will facilitate the standardisation of future Wasm features
while improving the consistency and trustworthiness of Wasm's various specification artefacts. 
We also believe that \dslname will facilitate the production of trustworthy mechanizations
in diverse theorem provers, including Coq, Isabelle, Agda, and Lean.
While \dslname is still currently in development,
it is already capable of generating a formal specification and prose pseudocode covering all of Wasm 2.0 minus the SIMD instructions,
and an extracted Wasm semantics which passes all 23,778 applicable tests in the official Wasm test suite.
%
We continue to work on further backends for automatically generating unit tests and full theorem prover definitions.
%
We intend to use upcoming Wasm features such as Exception Handling,
Garbage-Collected Types, and Threads to further evaluate the utility and applicability of \dslname.
%
We acknowledge that a key challenge moving forward will be transitioning \dslname from a research tool to a robust and maintainable part of the Wasm industry standards ecosystem, and we intend to work with key Wasm industry stakeholders to achieve this goal.
